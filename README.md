# Contact/Address Book (Rest Backend) Concept - Assessment
A nodejs based REST application which will serve as a data source for an existing Contact/Address book web and mobile application.
The application will expose two rest resources

Auth Resource – This will handle endpoints for authentication which will include, login, signup etc
Contact Resource – This will handle CRUD endpoints for managing a user’s contact list. All endpoints in this resource should only be accessed by an authenticated and authorized user.
The project will persist data to a mongodb database. A local database can be used but do provide instructions for reproducing the database.
